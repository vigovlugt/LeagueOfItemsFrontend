# What is League of Items?

League of Items is like [U.GG](https://u.gg) but for items and runes. Instead of pages for champions here you will find
pages for items, on these pages you can see which champions use this item and other relevant information.

# How do I use it?

Say you like [Shurelya's Battlesong](/items/2065), but don't know what champions to play it on, or want to find new
champions. On this site you can see the best champions you can play it with.  
You can also see analytics for this item on it's page, if this item is better as first or second item or maybe last.  
Each champion also has its own page, this is more like U.GG, but shows more data. If an item is very good on a champion,
but not build as often, you will not see it on U.GG but you will here.  
There are also tierlists for the items and runes where you can see what rune or items is played most and what has the
highest winrate.  
Also the high-res item images are pretty neat.

# Where does the data come from?

All data is scraped from [U.GG](https://u.gg). The data analyzed is from Plat+ of all regions.

# How often is the site updated?

Every 4 hours.

# Why do most items have such a high winrates?

The winning team often has more items, so that would inflate the winrates of the items that team built.  
This also means items which are built later in the game ([Guardian Angel](/items/3026), [Warmog's Armor](/items/3083))
have higher winrates, and items which are generally built first, lower winrates.  
Additionally, some items are only built when already winning, like [Mejai's Soulstealer](/items/3041).

# How are pickrates of champions/items/runes calculated?

This is calculated as the amount of matches for this champion/rune/item divided by the amount of matches data is
gathered from.  
This means that if a champion has a pickrate of 25%, you will on average see it in 1 out of 4 games.

# How can items/runes have higher pickrates than 100%?

If an item has a pickrate of 100% it is built once per game on average, so if an item for example has a 200% pickrate it
would be built twice per game on average.
